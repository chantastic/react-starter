## Usage

Get dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run webpack with option (progress, color, watch):

```
npm start
```

Compile bundle without watching:

```
webpack
```

You can get fancy by using the
[webpack-dev-server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/#development-server).
